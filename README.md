## Hello!

I used to make games, and you can find them on [itch.io](https://shadow00dev.itch.io/).

My main project right now is **Shadows Heropack**, a custom heropack for the Minecraft mod **Fisk's Superheroes** (version 1.7.10).  
Check it out here: [Shadows Heropack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/shadows-heropack)

I am a Minecraft mod developer and my first mod is [Shadows Tonfas](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shadows-tonfas) (At the most I am a beginner)

I also have a simple website:
